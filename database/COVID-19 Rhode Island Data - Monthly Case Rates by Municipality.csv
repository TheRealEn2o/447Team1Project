"NOTES: Calculations based on small numbers (<5) are shown as *, in line with RIDOH's Small Numbers Policy. We provide monthly data to help show more reliable trends over time. Fluctuations in these data may be due to a variety of factors, such as peopleâ€™s movement across municipalities. Please use caution when interpreting these data as other factors can increase risk for illness.
 
Residents in congregate care settings such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes, correctional facilities, and homeless shelters are intentionally excluded from these data. Because congregate care settings are not distributed equally across the state, and because spread within a congregate care setting does not correlate to spread within the community in which it resides, these cases have been excluded from this analysis in order to provide a more accurate picture of COVID-19 cases within the broader municipality. Out-of-state residents are also excluded from this analysis.

Rates calculated from number of cases (may count people more than once)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
